## REST API overviiew

With this VendorMachineApp we can get:
* If the user hasnâ€™t added enough money, the app will provide a message indicating they need to add x more cents.
* If the user has added exact money, the app will provide a message indicating they can keep buying.
* If the user has added more than enough money, the app will provide a message indicating they can keep buying, and the extra balance.
* All of a new set of products can be added CSV upload.

**Get postVendorMachine to start or keep buying**

````curl -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-type: application/json" -X POST -d "{\"cents\": 0.0, \"bills\": 0.0, \"totalAmount\": 0.0, \"vmItem\": {\"code\": \"value1\" }}" http://localhost:8080/vm/postVendorMachine````

### Targeting the REST API with Postman
Alternatively to curl, you can use Postman to target the REST API.
